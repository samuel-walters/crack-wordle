# Wordle Cracker

A script that can crack the daily Wordle puzzle by using letter positioning, letter frequency and word frequency to narrow down the list of possible answers.

The results from simulating 10,000 games of Wordle can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file named `evaluate.ipynb`. 

If you want to use the algorithm yourself, then run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory you have cloned the repository. Afterwards, type `python machine_vs_wordle.py` and follow the instructions in the terminal.
